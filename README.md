â”œâ”€â”€ bot.py              # Main bot application
â”œâ”€â”€ database.py         # Database operations and models
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies

## Development

### Running in Development
```bash
python bot.py
```

### Adding New Features
The bot architecture supports easy extension:
- Add new commands in `bot.py`
- Extend database schema in `database.py`
- Use conversation handlers for multi-step interactions

### Error Handling
- Database operations include proper error handling
- Users receive friendly error messages
- Logging is configured for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Bot not responding**: Check if your bot token is correct
2. **Database errors**: Ensure write permissions in the project directory
3. **Users not getting notifications**: They need to start a conversation with the bot first

### Logs
The bot logs important events to the console. Check for error messages if something isn't working.

## Security Considerations

- Bot token should be kept secret
- Database file contains user information - secure appropriately
- Consider user privacy when deploying in production
